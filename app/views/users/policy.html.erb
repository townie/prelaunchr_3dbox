Information Collected.
At your election, you may request additional information about 3dbox.club’s. When you do so, you may need to submit certain information or data to 3dbox.club’s, for example, your contact information (collectively, User Data).
When you visit the Site, web servers collect "traffic data" (such as, for example, time and date, the address of the website from which you entered the Site) about your visit, which is stored as anonymous, aggregate data. Collecting such data may entail the use of IP addresses or other numeric codes used to identify a computer.

3dbox.club’s’s uses User Data to respond to your inquiries for additional information.
3dbox.club’s’s uses "traffic data" to help diagnose problems with its server, analyze trends and administer the Site. Your IP address is not linked to personally identifiable information, but is used to gather broad demographic data and to monitor statistics to improve the Site and Service.
Sharing of Information.
Currently, 3dbox.club’s will not share personally identifiable information with any third party for commercial purposes. 3dbox.club’s may, however, disclose personally identifiable data if (1) reasonably necessary to perform the Service, (2) authorized by you, (3) otherwise permitted under this Privacy Policy or (4) 3dbox.club’s is required to do so by law or regulation, or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to (i) conform or comply with applicable laws, regulations or legal process, (ii) protect or defend the rights or property of 3dbox.club’s or any other user or (iii) enforce the Terms of Use.
3dbox.club’s may transfer personally identifiable information to any successor to all or substantially all of its business or assets that concern the Service.
Security.
Information collected by 3dbox.club’s is stored in secure operating environments that are not made generally available to the public. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, 3dbox.club’s cannot ensure the security of any information you provide, and you do so at your own risk. Once 3dbox.club’s receives your transmission, it will make reasonable efforts to ensure its security on its systems.

The Site may permit you to link to other websites on the Internet, and other websites may contain links to the Site. These other websites are not under 3dbox.club’s control. The privacy and security practices of websites linked to or from the Site are not covered by this Privacy Policy, and 3dbox.club’s is not responsible for the privacy or security practices or the content of such websites.
IP Addresses and Cookies.
3dbox.club’s may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with its server, and to administer the Site. Your IP address is used to help identify you and to gather broad demographic information. IP addresses are also used to provide an audit trail in the case of any attempted illegal or unauthorized use of the Site.
"Cookies" are pieces of information that a website transfers to your computer's hard disk for record-keeping purposes. Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they do identify a user's computer. You may be able to set your web browser to refuse cookies.
